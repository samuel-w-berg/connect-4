Connect Four Game
This is a digital version of the classic game, Connect Four. The game is designed to be played by two players taking turns to drop colored pieces from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own pieces of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

How to Play

When the game loads, you will see a blank grid with "Place Here" buttons, indicating which column you would like to drop your piece into.
The game starts with the player, who drops one of their pieces into any column of the grid by clicking on the corresponding button.
The piece will fall to the lowest available row in that column.
The computer then takes their turn and drops their own disc into a random slot.
The game continues in this way until either the player or computer gets four of their own pieces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is full with no more valid moves.
The game ends with a message indicating who won.

Technologies Used
The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
